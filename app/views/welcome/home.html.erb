<h1> Welcome to the Online Library! </h1>

<p>The Online Library makes you both the librarian and reader: Lend out the e-books you own,
  and borrow e-books from other users. Every user starts with 1 credit to rent a book of their
  choosing. Most books are only 1 credit to rent, unless otherwise specified. Once you borrow
  a book, keep it for up to one month. Once you return it, you'll be able to rent another!</p>
