<h1 id="intro"> Welcome to the Online Library! </h1>

<p id="intro">The Online Library makes you both the librarian and reader: Lend out the e-books you own,
  and borrow e-books from other users.
  <br>
  Every user starts with 5 credits to rent books of their
  choosing. Most books are only 1 credit to rent, unless otherwise specified.
  <br>
  Once you return a book, you'll get your credit back so you can rent another!</p>
